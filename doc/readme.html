<h1>Sider 7 for Pro Evolution Soccer 2021</h1>
<h4>version 7.3.0 from October 15, 2024</h4>
<a href="history.txt">history.txt</a>

<h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>

<p>Sider is a companion program for PES 2021 and PES 2021 Lite. It allows for
small tweaks - such as "free side-select" (which is where sider gets its name from),
and time expander for the demo version. It also facilitates game mods, created by the
modding community. The two main features are LiveCPK and the scripting engine, where you can write your
own mods in Lua programming language.</p>

<p>LiveCPK makes it possible to replace game content
at run-time with content from files stored on disk, instead of
having to pack everything into CPK-archives. (This feature
is similar to Kitserver's AFS2FS and to FileLoader for earler
versions of PES). Depending on how and when exactly the game
reads the replaced files, you can even live-edit some things,
like textures or 3D models, without exiting the game.</p>

<p>If you know a little bit how to program, you can write your own
game logic using Sider's scripting engine. This requires some reading and understanding of how the game
works, but it's really not that hard ;-)
See <a href="scripting.html">scripting.html</a>
- for detailed documentation on that.</p>

<h3>HOW TO INSTALL AND RUN</h3>

<p>There are two ways to install and run <b>sider</b>:
<ol>
<li style="margin-bottom:0.5em">Using <b>sider.exe</b> helper program (the "standard way").<br />
This is the simplest and recommended way to use sider with the game, if you running on Windows.
Continue reading this document for how to do that.</li>
<li>Patching game executable with <b>patcher.exe</b> (the "alternative way" or old-kitserver-style, if you will).<br />
This can be a better approach if you are running the game on Steam Deck, Linux, or macOS with Wine/Whisky. See 
<a href="install-with-patcher.html">install-with-patcher.html</a> - for detailed instructions.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<h3>HOW TO INSTALL FOR USING WITH SIDER.EXE</h3>

<p>Move the folder that you just unpacked from the ZIP archive into a place, where your Windows user account has
full permissions. I very <b>strongly recommend</b> to use one of these standard locations:
Desktop, Documents, or your home directory.</p>

<p>
<a href="cap1.jpg"><img src="cap1.jpg" height="200"/></a>
<a href="cap2.jpg"><img src="cap2.jpg" height="200"/></a>
<a href="cap3.jpg"><img src="cap3.jpg" height="200"/></a>
</p>

<p>Starting with version 6.3, sider has no external dependences, meaning
that everything that sider requires is included in its folder.
You do not need to install any additional software to be able to run sider.
You must have at least Windows 7 64-bit or newer (Sider will not work on XP/Vista).</p>

<div class="warn">
<p>People sometimes take sider files and stuff them into Steam's directory
for PES 2021. I am not entirely sure where that idea originated. One possibilty is a
"carry-over knowledge" of how Kitserver worked for old-gen PES games. However, in the
case of sider, this is not a good way to organize things. In fact, it is a pretty bad idea, because:
<ol>
<li>you mix sider files with game files, and it can be tricky to
remember which files belong to sider and which ones - to the game. Uninstalling
sider then becomes more difficult.</li>
<li>sider needs to create sider.log file and create and update various *.cache and *.ini files. If it has
trouble doing so, due to folder permissions, it can lead to errors and crashes.
<li>Steam may need/choose to "verify" game files, which can result in some of the
sider files being deleted or corrupted in some way.</li>
</ol>
So, in other words, don't do it. There is absolutely no need for it.</p>
</div>

<h3>HOW TO UNINSTALL</h3>

<p class="note">Before uninstalling, remember that you can always run the game <b>without</b> sider, for
whatever reason. To do that, simply start the game via Steam or Steam desktop shortcut.
(Like you normally would, if you didn't have sider)</p>

<p>If you want to completely remove sider from your computer, simply delete
its folder, and that is it - uninstallation complete.</p>


<h3>HOW TO USE</h3>

<p>Sider itself does not require Administrator privileges, you should
run it under your regular account - the same one as you would use to
start the game without Sider.</p>

<h4>The new method (preferred)</h4>

<p>The new <b>one-click</b> way is enabled by default now and it is super easy:
just run <span class="file">sider.exe</span>, it will open a small window, then it will automatically
launch the game itself, then Sider application will exit, but the game will
continue running with the <span class="file">sider.dll</span> loaded into it.</p>

<p class="gwarn">The very first time (or after Steam downloads a new, updated PES2021.exe), there will be a small delay
between the launch of sider and the game starting - maybe 5-10 seconds, as sider needs to
analyze the process and find hook places in memory. However, next time you do it, the game
should start quickly (normally).</p>

<h4>The old method</h4>
<p>The "old" way is still supported too and if you prefer that, the
sequence is the same as before. Make sure you comment out the
"start.game" line in <span class="file">sider.ini</span>, and then:</p>
<ol>
<li>Run <span class="file">sider.exe</span>, it will open a small window, which you can
minimize if you want, but do not close it.</li>
<li>Run the game. Sider should automatically attach to the game process.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you don't see the effects of Sider in the game, check the
<span class="file">sider.log</span> file (in the same folder where <span class="file">sider.exe</span> is) - it should
contain some helpful information on what went wrong.</p>


<h3>SETTINGS (SIDER.INI)</h3>

<p>There are several settings you can set in <span class="file">sider.ini</span>:</p>

<pre>
start.game = "steam://rungameid/1259970"
</pre>

<p>- optional setting. If it is specified, then Sider will
operate in a new <b>"one-click launch" mode</b>: first, Sider will
launch the game, using the provided steam url, then wait
for the game to start and for <span class="file">sider.dll</span> to be loaded into
the game process. After that, sider application will exit, but the
game will continue with Sider activated - via <span class="file">sider.dll</span>.</p>


<pre>
exe.name = "\PES2021.exe"
</pre>

<p>- this sets the pattern(s) that the Sider program will use
to identify which of the running processes is the game.
You can have multiple "exe.name" lines in your <span class="file">sider.ini</span>,
which is useful, for example, if you have several exe
files with slightly different names that you use for
online/offline play.</p>


<pre>
free.side.select = 1
</pre>

<p>- enables free movement of controllers. Normally, it is
only possible in Exhibition modes, but with this setting
set to 1, you will be able to move the controllers in the
competition modes too.</p>

<p>The 1st controller can also be moved into the middle,
disabling it effectively. Use this carefully in the
matches: if you move 1st controller into the middle, make
sure that you have at least one other controller on the left
or on the right. Otherwise, you will lose the control of the
match. (default is: 0 - free movement disabled)</p>


<pre>
livecpk.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>- Turns on the LiveCPK functionality of Sider. See below for a more
detailed explanation in cpk.root option section.</p>


<pre>
debug = 0
</pre>

<p>- Setting this to values &gt; 0 will make Sider output some additional information
into the log file (<span class="file">sider.log</span>). This is useful primarily for troubleshooting.
Extra logging may slow the game down, so normally you would want to keep
this setting set to 0. (Defaults to 0: some info, but no extra output)</p>


<pre>
close.on.exit = 0
</pre>

<p>- If this setting is set to 1, then Sider will close itself, when the
game exits. This can be handy, if you use a batch file to start sider
automatically right before the game is launched.
(Defaults to 0: do not close)</p>


<pre>
start.minimized = 0
</pre>

<p>- If you set this to 1, then Sider will start with a minimized window.
Again, like the previous option, this setting can be helpful, if you
use a batch file to auto-start sider, just before the game launches.
(Defaults to 0: normal window)</p>

<pre>
cpk.root = "c:\cpk-roots\balls-root"
cpk.root = "c:\cpk-roots\kits-root"
cpk.root = ".\another-root\stadiums"
cpk.root = ".\livecpk\example-root"
</pre>

<p>- Specifies root folder (or folders), where the game files are stored that
will be used for content replacing at run-time. It works like this:
For example, the game wants to load a file that is stored in some CPK, with
the relative path of <span class="pathname">common/render/thumbnail/ball/ball_001.dds</span>. Sider
will intercept that action and check if one of the root folders have this
file. If so, Sider will make the game read the content from that file instead
of using game's original content. If multiple roots are specified, then
they are checked in order that they are listed in <span class="file">sider.ini</span>. As soon as there
is a filename match, the lookup stops. (So, higher cpk.root wins, if several of
them have the same file). You can use either absolute paths or relative.
Relative paths will be calculated relative to the folder where <span class="file">sider.exe</span> is
located.</p>


<pre>
lua.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>- This turns on/off the scripting support. Extension modules can be
written in Lua 5.1 (LuaJIT), using a subset of standard libraries and
also objects and events provides by sider. See <a href="scripting.html">scripting.html</a> for
a programmer's guide to writing lua modules for sider.</p>

<pre>
lua.module = "camera.lua"
lua.module = "kitrewrite.lua"
</pre>

<p>- Specifies the order in which the extension modules are loaded. These
modules must be in "modules" folder inside the sider root directory.</p>

<pre>
jit.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>- Allows to enable/disable JIT (Just-In-Time compiler) for Lua.
By default, JIT is enabled - to provide performance boost for Lua modules.
To turn it off, set to 0.</p>

<pre>
lua.gc.opt = "step"
</pre>

- This option allows to tweak Lua garbage collector (GC) behaviour.
Two supported values are: "step" - for incremental collection, and
"collect" - for full collection. Default is "step", and typically,
you do not need to modify this, unless you see Lua memory errors
in the log. In which case, try "collect".

<pre>
overlay.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>- This option enables an interactive overlay. The overlay can display
text that is provided by Lua modules, with one module having control
of the overlay at any given time. By pressing hotkeys (set by
<b>overlay.vkey.next-module</b> and <b>overlay.vkey.prev-module</b> options)
the control of the overlay can be switched to the next or to the previous
module, and so on. The overlay is toggled on/off with another
hotkey, set by <b>overlay.vkey.toggle</b> option. When the overlay is on, the
key presses are passed on to the module that is currently in control of
the overlay. The module can handle those key events in whatever way
it needs to, or ignore them altogether. For more information, see
<a href="scripting.html">scripting.html</a></p>


<pre>
overlay.on-from-start = 1
</pre>

<p>- If set to 1, the overlay will appear as soon as possible, after
the start of the game.
(default is 0, meaning that overlay starts hidden, until toggled on)</p>


<pre>
overlay.location = "bottom"
</pre>

<p>- two possible locations: "top" and "bottom" of the screen</p>

<pre>
overlay.font-size = 0
overlay.font = "Consolas"
</pre>

<p>- these two options control the font of overlay. Size 0 means that
the font-size will be calculated automatically, based on height of
the screen in pixels. Any TTF font installed on the system can be
used, but monospaced fonts are recommended for easier formatting.</p>

<pre>
overlay.vkey.toggle = 0x20
overlay.vkey.next-module = 0x31
overlay.vkey.prev-module = 0xc0
</pre>

<p>- hot keys for toggling overlay on/off, and for switching control
of the overlay among the modules. Values must be specified in
hexadecimal format. The default ones are:
<ul>
    <li>0x20 [Space] - for toggle</li>
    <li>0x31 [1]     - for next module</li>
    <li>0xc0 [~]     - for previous module</li>
</ul>
Full list of codes for all keys can be found here:
<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes">
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/inputdev/virtual-key-codes</a></p>

<pre>
overlay.background-color = "102010c0"
overlay.text-color = "80ff80c0"
</pre>

<p>- colors are specified in RRGGBBAA format (similar to how it is
done in HTML, except that you do not put '#' character in front)</p>


<pre>
overlay.image-alpha-max = 0.8
</pre>

<p>- max value for alpha channel for the image displayed in the overlay
(if there is one). This is useful, if you want the image to be slightly
translucent, as a visual hint that it is part of overlay. A value around
0.7 or 0.8 would give such effect.
Defaults to 1.0. The accepted range of values are: [0.0 - 1.0]
<ul>
    <li>0.0 : fully transparent</li>
    <li>1.0 : original alpha channel of the image is kept unmodified.</li>
</ul></p>

<pre>
overlay.block-input-when-on = 0
</pre>

<p>- if set to 1, this option will block all input from keyboard and
game controllers to the game, when overlay is on. (Defaults to 0 - no blocking)</p>

<pre>
overlay.gamepad-input-blocking.enabled = 1
</pre>

<p>- if set to 0, then sider will not enforce input blocking for gamepads.
(Defaults to 1 - blocking logic enabled).<br />
Normally, you do not need to worry about this, but if you experience an early
crash, pretty much on startup, before the game even is able to show the red
Konami screen, then try setting this option to 0. It should help.
</p>

<pre>
vkey.reload-1 = 0x10
vkey.reload-2 = 0x52
</pre>

<p>- These two settings define a hot-key combination that can be used
to reload Lua modules, without restarting the game. This is not a feature
that you would normally use during regular gameplay, but if you are
writing a module, very often you need to make a small fix or change.
Restarting the game every time can be time consuming, so this feature
allows to reload all modules that were modified since the last time
they were loaded. Default is: Shift-R  (0x10 and 0x52).</p>


<pre>
game.priority.class = "above_normal"
</pre>

<p>- This option allows to change the priority of the game process. Sometimes
this is useful, and reportedly can help to combat FPS drops. Supported values
are: "above_normal", "below_normal", "high", "idle", "normal" and "realtime".
By default, the game sets its priority to "above_normal".</p>
