<h1>Sider 7 for Pro Evolution Soccer 2021</h1>
<h4>version 7.3.0 from October 15, 2024</h4>

<h3>HOW TO INSTALL USING PATCHER</h3>

<p>Now that you have already unpacked the sider zip archive, you will see the folder called <b>sider</b> inside.
Move that folder inside the game directory, so that it looks like on these pictures:</p>

</p>

<h4>Patching the game exe</h4>

<p>This is a step that needs to only be done once. (Or if game updates and new PES2021.exe is downloaded
you will need to run it again</p>

<p class="gwarn">You may want to make a copy of your PES2021.exe, just in case things go wrong, but even if you
don't do that, it can typically be recovered (restored to its original state) by verifying your files in Steam</p>

<p>The idea is that we need to "instruct" the game to load <b>sider.dll</b>, which is what contains
Sider engine and enables all the functionality that sider provides. This is done by running a utility
program called <b>patcher.exe</b>, which alters the game executable in a subtle way - basically making
it load sider.dll right after the game window is created</p>

<h3>HOW TO UNINSTALL</h3>

<p class="note">Before uninstalling, remember that you can always temporarily disable sider by 
renaming its directory, for example to <b>sider.disabled</b> or some other name like that.
This way, when the game runs, it will not be able to load <b>sider.dll</b> and will continue
without it</p>

<p>If you want to completely remove sider from your computer, simply delete
its folder, and that is it - uninstallation complete.</p>


<h3>HOW TO USE</h3>

<p>Just start the game as you normally would - via Steam UI, or a shortcut on desktop.
(If you successfully patched your PES2021.exe using the <b>patcher</b> program, the
game will load sider automatically)</p>

<p class="gwarn">The very first time (or after Steam downloads a new, updated PES2021.exe), there will be a small delay
between the launch of sider and the game starting - maybe 5-10 seconds, as sider needs to
analyze the process and find hook places in memory. However, next time you do it, the game
should start quickly (normally).</p>

<p>If you don't see the effects of Sider in the game, check the
<span class="file">sider.log</span> file (in the <b>sider</b> folder) - it should
contain some helpful information on what went wrong.</p>
